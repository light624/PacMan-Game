# PacMan Project - Java OOP Edition

## Overview
This project is a Java-based remake of the iconic PacMan game, embracing object-oriented programming (OOP) principles for a clean, modular design. It recreates the classic maze navigation and ghost evasion gameplay, with PacMan collecting bonuses to achieve a winning score of 1000 points. This project serves not only as a homage to the original game but also as a learning platform for Java OOP and collaborative software development.

## Features

- **Single-Level Challenge:** Aim to reach a score of 1000 points to win the game.
- **Open for Enhancements:** Contributors can add new features, levels, or refine existing mechanics.
